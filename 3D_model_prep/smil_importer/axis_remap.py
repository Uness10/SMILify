"""Bone-local -> model-frame rotation-limit remap (issue #56).

Pure-numpy helpers, deliberately free of any ``bpy`` import so they can be unit
tested without Blender (see ``tests/test_axis_remap.py``). ``core_mesh`` imports
these and applies them inside ``export_joint_limits_to_npy``.

Background
----------
A Limit Rotation constraint is authored in a bone's *local* frame, but the
fitter's ``LimitPrior`` compares the pose's *model-frame* axis-angle components
against the exported bounds. A rotation vector authored in bone-local
coordinates ``w_local`` appears in the model frame as ``w_model = B @ w_local``,
where ``B``'s columns are the bone-local x/y/z axes expressed in model
coordinates (``B = rot3(bone.matrix_local)``).

For the common "clean axis" case - ``B`` a signed permutation (each row/column a
single +/-1) - an axis-aligned box stays axis-aligned under the change of basis,
so the per-axis [min,max] bounds can be remapped exactly by permuting rows and
swapping/negating the sign-flipped axes. For a genuinely rotated (mixed-axis)
``B`` the box becomes tilted and no per-axis representation is exact; we keep the
bounds verbatim and warn (the bounded issue-#56 caveat).

    For a signed-permutation ``B``, model axis ``m`` equals exactly one bone-local
    axis ``k`` (optionally negated): a ``+`` keeps ``[lo_k, hi_k]``, a ``-`` gives
    ``[-hi_k, -lo_k]``. Identity ``B`` is a no-op. A mixed-axis ``B`` cannot be
    represented as a per-axis box, so the verbatim bounds are returned and a
    message is emitted — but only when the bounds were actually authored.

    Issue #56 (review): the message used to be a ``warnings.warn`` fired for
    EVERY bone with a non-signed-permutation rest orientation. On organically
    rigged models that meant a wall of warnings on the first export (one per
    bone, even for untouched wide-open defaults where the caveat is
    irrelevant) — and then *silence* on every later export in the same Blender
    session, because the ``warnings`` module dedupes per location. Now:

    - ``authored=False`` (untouched defaults) emits nothing;
    - the message goes through ``log`` (default ``print``), so every export is
      individually visible in the console. Pass ``log=None`` to silence.

    Returns ``(model_lo, model_hi)`` as plain 3-element lists.
